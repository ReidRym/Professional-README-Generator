## Installation
What are the steps required to install your project?


## Usage
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.



## license
The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. 
This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. 
If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).


## Contributing
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.



## Tests  
Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
